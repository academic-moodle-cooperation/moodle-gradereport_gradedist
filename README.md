Description
-----------

The Grade Distribution report visualizes the grades of students in a course. Changes to letter
grades (i.e. the boundary of a grade) can be analysed visually, saved and therefore overwritten if
necessary.


Example
-------

Usually letter grades of a course should be communicated to the students at the beginning of a
term. Occasionally it occurs that changes to letter grades are necessary. The grade distribution
visualizes the grades of students. Changes to letter grades (i.e. the boundary of a grade) can be
analysed visually, saved and therefore overwritten if necessary. By means of an alternating graphic
chart changes can be seen immediately.

------------

The plugin is available for Moodle 2.7+. This version is for Moodle 3.8.


Installation
------------

* Copy the module code directly to the *moodleroot/grade/report/gradedist* directory.

Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-gradereport_gradedist/issues).
Please provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if
applicable, a screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful
and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the
resources to provide detailed support.
