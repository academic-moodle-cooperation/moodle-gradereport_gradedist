Description
-----------

The grade distribution visualizes the distribution of the participants' letter grades in the grades overview. Changes to letter grades can be visually analysed, saved and overwritten if necessary.


Usage
-------

As a rule, letter grades for a course must be determined at the beginning of the semester and communicated to the students!
As a teacher, you can use the diagram displayed to check how the grades for an examination are distributed out. You can display the grade distribution for the course in total or any grading column with grade type "value". If grade levels have been selected unfavorably and readjustment is necessary, you can simulate changes to existing grade levels to see possible shifts in the distribution of results.


Installation
------------

* Copy the  code directly to the *grade/report/gradedist* directory.
* Log into Moodle as administrator.
* Open the administration area (*http://your-moodle-site/admin*) to start the installation
  automatically.


Privacy API
--------------
The plugin fully implements the Moodle Privacy API.


Documentation
--------------

You can find a documentation for the plugin on the [AMC website](https://academic-moodle-cooperation.org/gradereport_gradedist/)



Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-gradereport_gradedist/issues).
Please provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if
applicable, a screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful
and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the
resources to provide detailed support.
